General speech recognition systems are still largely speaker/situation dependent. Often seemingly subtle changes can affect the ability of the system to recognize commands. Differences, such as the choice of microphone or the number of people in a room, can interfere with some voice systems. It can be difficult to create or even predict the environment in which a VR experience will be run, making it difficult to train the voice system under the same circumstances in which it will need to perform.
